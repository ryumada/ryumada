### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Introduce me is ryumada. I am a Backend and Cloud Computing Enthusiast. Currently, I'm learning this topic by joining the Bangkit 2022 program. And I will keep improving myself in this field until I can finally go to the frontend topic to become a Full Stack Engineer.

Currently, these topics also interest me, such as the design system and principle, clean code, TDD, OOP, and the other programming principle that makes software development more convenient to develop and of course can keep its development in the future.
